/*
Partials You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files.
This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.
A partial is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. 
You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and
that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.
